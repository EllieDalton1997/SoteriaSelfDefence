      <h><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h>
        <p>Soteria was founded with one goal in mind - to make self-defence ​accessible to everyone. This meant building a unique system from ​scratch that was simple, realistic, effective and could be delivered ​anywhere.
 <br><br> Here’s how we did it:<br> <br><br>
  SIMPLE - Our system is easy to remember in the heat of the moment, ​constructed of easy-to-perform techniques that can be learnt and ​executed by anyone in as little as 1 hour 
  <br> <br><br>REALISTIC - We based our system on common self-defence scenarios ​adapting traditional martial arts techniques for real-world application. ​We even offer bespoke solutions meaning that whatever situations are ​causing anxiety to you or the people you care about we will work with ​you to provide the answers you need.
  <br> <br><br> EFFECTIVE - We’re unique in that we designed our entire system from ​a woman's point of view. Using mathematical mechanics principles to ​ensure they work against bigger, stronger attackers. 
  <br> <br><br>MOBILE - We can teach from anywhere, whether it’s in our gym or ​your place of work ensuring even the busiest of people can ​participate.
